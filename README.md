# Take-Home Test

## Overview

Welcome to the take-home test! The goal of this task is to evaluate your skills in React and working with APIs. You will build a simple application using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) to fetch and display data about Pokémon.

## Requirements

1. **Framework**: Use React or any React Meta framework. Using Typescript is a must!
2. **Styling**: Use tailwindcss
2. **API**: Utilize the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) to fetch Pokémon data.
3. **Functionality**:
    - Display a list of Pokémon with their names and images.
    - Allow the user to search for Pokémon by name.
    - Implement pagination  to navigate through the list.
    - Display additional details (like abilities, types, and stats) when a Pokémon is clicked on a new page.
    - On each pokemon, attach a "Add to Pokedex" that saves the pokemon into pokedex (imagine adding product to a cart).
    - Persist Pokedex in between page navigation and browser refresh.
4. **UI/UX**: Create a clean  UI. Styling and design decisions are up to you, but aim for a user-friendly interface.
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors, such as when the API is down or returns an error.
6. **Performance**: Optimize for performance, especially regarding API calls and rendering.


## Submission

1. Push your code to a public GitHub repository.
2. Provide a README file with instructions on how to run the project locally.
3. Include any notes or comments on your approach, decisions made, and any known issues or improvements you would make with more time.
4. Deploy project to [vercel](https://vercel.com/) or any web host.
5. Share the repository link and the project domain with us when you're done.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- **Functionality**: Meets the requirements outlined.
- **UI/UX**: A clean and user-friendly interface.
- **Performance**: Efficient data fetching and rendering.
